## Summary

The analysis so far seems to point towards high usage from men and from commutes to and from work.  In addition to the analysis we already have it would serve the stakeholders to better understand starting and stopping stations that are most commonly used to better understand how Des Moines can best utilize where to station their bikes and how to cycle to best maintain them and to ensure they are always available in places where they are most needed.
